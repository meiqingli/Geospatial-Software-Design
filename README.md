# CPLN670 Geospatial Software Design Final Project

As an integrate part of the final project for CPLN 670 Geospatial Software Design, the Google Earth Engine project
aims to develop a generalizable tool/method that can be easily applied to different contexts and scales for estimation purpose.
Using the Google Earth Engine platform, the tool standardizes the procedure of filtering, classifying, resampling, visualizing and computing satellite imagery. It outputs estimates of urban intensity within a specific geographic area and time period, which can be validated by actual socio-economic data in ArcGIS (the ArcPy project for this class).

The ArcPy application for second part of this project continues the exploration of NTL data by taking the output from raster processing in Google Earth Engine, and compare the estimation with socio-economic factors indicated by census and spatial data. It outputs a series of tables that contain comprehensive information for more rigorous statistical analysis.
